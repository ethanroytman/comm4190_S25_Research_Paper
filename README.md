# LLMs in Telehealth

This project examines the potential use of Large Language Models, such as GPT-4, in telehealth communication. It explores how LLMs can assist with patient triage, chronic disease monitoring, and clinical documentation, highlighting both their advantages,like improved efficiency and accessibility, and their limitations, including accuracy risks and the need for physician oversight.

The second half of the paper focuses on prompt engineering, offering example strategies for guiding LLMs in real-world telehealth tasks such as intake interviews, symptom checking, and medical note generation.

Together, this work shows how LLMs, when carefully prompted and responsibly deployed, could help make telehealth more scalable, patient-centered, and effective.
